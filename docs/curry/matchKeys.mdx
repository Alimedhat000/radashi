## Basic usage

You have a utility function that is filtering an object's properties somehow. Using `matchKeys` will allow your function to filter those properties based on either an array of keys (an allowlist) or a function that returns a boolean for each property.

```ts
import { matchKeys, KeyFilter } from 'radash'

// Define your function with a `KeyFilter` parameter type,
// then use `matchKeys` to create a function that will
// filter the object's properties for you.
function filterObjectSomeway(obj: object, keys: KeyFilter) {
  const matches = matchKeys(keys)
  for (const key in obj) {
    const value = obj[key]
    if (matches(value, key, obj)) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

In the next example, the `obj` whose properties are being filtered is passed into `matchKeys` to simplify the signature of the returned function. Notice how we call `matches(key)` instead of the `matches(value, key, obj)` from the previous example. Both ways have their trade-offs, but this way is the one you'll probably use most often.

```ts
function filterObjectSomehow(obj: object, keys: KeyFilter) {
  const matches = matchKeys(keys, obj)
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (matches(key)) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```
