title: assert
description: Asserts a condition and narrows the type of the value
---

### Usage

Asserts that a condition is true. If the condition is false, an error is
thrown. This function uses TypeScript's `asserts` keyword to narrow the
type of the value being asserted.

An optional message can be provided, which will be used as the error message
if the assertion fails. If the message is an instance of `Error`, that error
will be thrown directly.

If the `condition` argument is a `false` literal, the function's return type
is `never`, indicating that the code path following the assertion is
unreachable.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

function processValue(value: string | null) {
  _.assert(value !== null, 'Value cannot be null')
  // value is now narrowed to string
  console.log(value.toUpperCase())
}

processValue('hello') // logs "HELLO"
// processValue(null) // throws Error: Value cannot be null

const result = _.assert(false, 'This will always throw')
// const x = result // x is of type never
```
