title: ownPropertyValues
description: Create a generator of an object's own property values
---

## Basic usage

Iterates over an object's own property values in a lazy manner. This is more efficient than `Object.values` when the `for..of` loop is ended early with `break` or `return`.

- Symbol properties are skipped.
- Inherited properties are skipped.
- Non-enumerable properties are skipped.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const data = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
}

for (const value of _.ownPropertyValues(data)) {
  console.log(value)
}
```

### Use Cases

This function is best when you need more accurate TypeScript inference than what `Object.values` provides or when you need to iterate over the object's own properties in a lazy manner for efficiency. It's particularly useful for objects with hundreds or thousands of properties. As seen below, it pairs well with `selectFirst` due to its indeterminate nature.

```ts
const data = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
}

_.selectFirst(
  _.ownPropertyValues(data),
  value => value,
  value => value > 1,
)
// => 2
```

### TypeScript Limitations

Note that the return type isn't entirely accurate, since it includes instance methods that won't actually be yielded. TypeScript currently has no way to omit inherited properties.

In addition, non-enumerable properties are not yielded, but TypeScript will say they are. For these reasons, it's recommended to use this only with plain objects being used as maps.
